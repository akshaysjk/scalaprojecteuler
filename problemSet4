Problem 4 
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Solution: -

val r = (100 to 999).view.flatMap(i => (i to 999).map(_*i)).filter(
 n => n.toString == n.toString.reverse).max
