ProblemSet 6: 
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Solution : -
def square(n: Int) = n * n

val r = square(List.range(1,101).sum) - List.range(1,101).map(square).sum


Another approach
val list = List.range(1,101)
val r =list.sum*list.sum - list.foldLeft(0)((b, a) => (b + a*a))

/* foldLeft is tail recursive can be used in the implementation
